# tryswiftdev 🛠

This is a command line tool for open-source projects. 💁

Currently, support **OS X only**. 🙏

<br />

### A Work In Progress

This project has been rewriting in _**Swift**_.

It is built with the _**Swift Package Manager**_.

Maybe it is easily to write a shell (e.g. Bash), _but this is exactly **"try! Swift"**._
